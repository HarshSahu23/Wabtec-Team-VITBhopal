E_DV1_TOUT, E_DV2_TOUT, E_DV3_TOUT, E_DV4_TOUT


some example of such errors are : {AXLE1_LOCK, AXLE2_LOCK, AXLE3_LOCK, AXLE4_LOCK} or {E_DV1_TOUT, E_DV2_TOUT, E_DV3_TOUT, E_DV4_TOUT}

so what you need to do is generate a data frame that groups errors which has same starting names but differ from each other by a digit (like AXLE1, AXLE2) or differ from each other by a segment (E_DV1, E_DV2). 

Create a data frame that groups such types of errors along with their remaining columns from the csv. I would need to plot those remaining data in GUI at some point so preserve them as well. 

Also to each group type, create a column indicating the keyword 


from the "error x.csv" files ecl and ecf data frames are generated. The csv files contains various error descriptions like E_WSP_FAILURE, E_ZERO_SPEED, E_DEVICE_ON, E_SPEED_5_1, E_SPEED_5_2, E_SS_SC_OC2, AXLE1_LOCK, AXLE2_LOCK, AXLE3_LOCK, AXLE4_LOCK, E_DV1_TOUT, E_DV2_TOUT, AXLE3_LOCK GONE, AXLE4_LOCK GONE, E_SS_SC_OC2 GONE, E_DV1_TOUT GONE, E_DV2_TOUT GONE

A) filter out all those errors which are like "ABC_XYZ GONE". We don't need the errors which contains the "GONE" word. 
B) There is an exhaustive list which groups all the errors in various groups.  One error belongs to only one group. The list is as follows :
Axle Lock Group
AXLE1_LOCK
AXLE2_LOCK
AXLE3_LOCK
AXLE4_LOCK

Speed Sesnsor Error
E_SENS_FR1
E_SENS_FR2
E_SENS_FR3
E_SENS_FR4

DUMP valve Errors
E_DV1_TOUT
E_DV2_TOUT
E_DV3_TOUT
E_DV4_TOUT
E_DV1_OC
E_DV2_OC
E_DV3_OC
E_DV4_OC

Board Errors
E_ZERO_SPEED
E_SPEED_5
E_SPEED_5_1
E_SPEED_5_2
E_SPEED_30
E_SPEED_45
E_WSP_FAILURE
E_DEVICE_ON

POWER ON Event
I_POWER_ON 

C) For the remaining errors, you need to group them according to the list. Create a separate data frame for them. 
D) Inside the data frame, include the remaining column headers for the error description. For example if a row looks like : [6;0x6017;0x00005ACB;31/7/24;13:28:54;0x000;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;1;0;1;1;0;0;E_SPEED_5] ; then you need to obviously group this into Board Errors but also preserve all the remaining data like hex code, data etc. 
E) When you group the errors, introduce an extra column telling the group the belongs to , for example AXLE3_LOCK will belong to the group "Axle Lock"

write python code that restructures the original data frame to include the group of error the error description belongs to. In future I want the user to plot graph based on two types - individually choosing the errors from a list or choosing the error group and then we will plot all those errors belonging to that group. 

So yeah restructure the data frame to include these. 

[don't worry about the DMP_LOG file class, these errors don't occur in that file class]

FutureWarning:

A value is trying to be set on a copy of a DataFrame or Series through chained assignment using an inplace method.
The behavior will change in pandas 3.0. This inplace method will never work because the intermediate object on which we are setting values always behaves as a copy.

For example, when doing 'df[col].method(value, inplace=True)', try using 'df.method({col: value}, inplace=True)' or df[col] = df[col].method(value) instead, to perform the operation inplace on the original object.
